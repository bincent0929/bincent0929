I'm currently a student. I'm going to Shasta College for a degree in Computer Science.

I've done Python, C++, and HTML with CSS. The latter two being from freeCodeCamp.com.

I have a server that I run self-hosted software on such as Gitea, Nextcloud, Calibre, etc. My favorite piece of software would have to be Tailscale because I just think it's so amazing how it links all of my services together and makes it easy to add devices.
