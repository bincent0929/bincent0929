## Hello, I'm Vincent

### I'm currently a student in college. I'm going to Shasta College. It's real far up in California and transferring to a university this fall semester.

I've done **Python**, **C++**, and **HTML with CSS**. The latter two I learned from freeCodeCamp.com. And The ladder learned from college.

In terms of extra-curriculars, I run my own server using Fedora Server. On that server, using docker, I have containers with Gitea, Nextcloud, Biwarden, etc. with a Caddy container exposing those services to anyone conencted to my [Tailscale VPN](https://tailscale.com/). In terms of those who connect to it, I have my Dad, Mom, and brothers as users. I'm using [rclone](https://github.com/rclone/rclone) to backup up any info created by my dockers. 

I also run OPNsense on my home router, though I haven't gotten super in depth with it. 

My favorite piece of software would have to be Tailscale because I just think it's so amazing how it links all of my services together and makes it so easy to add devices.

Through doing these projects I've learned a lot about *configuring software* and getting it to do things that I want it to do. I did A LOT of **troubleshooting**, and most importantly **learning**.

I'm looking forward to creating and editing software in addition to my hobby of learning how to use cool softwares.
