## Hello, I'm Vincent

### I'm currently a student. I'm going to Shasta College real far up in California for a degree in Computer Science.

I've done Python, C++, and HTML with CSS. The latter two I learned from freeCodeCamp.com.

I have a server that I run self-hosted software on such as Gitea, Nextcloud, Calibre, etc. I also run OPNsense on my home router. My favorite piece of software would have to be Tailscale because I just think it's so amazing how it links all of my services together and makes it easy to add devices.

Through doing these projects I've learned a lot about configuring software and getting it to do things that I want it to do. It was A LOT of troubleshooting and learning.

I've just recently started down the path of coding solutions rather than finding solutions that other people have coded.
