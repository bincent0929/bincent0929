## Hello, I'm Vincent

### I'm currently a student in college. I'm taking classes at Shasta College and CSU Chico. Up in the farther north region of California. Farms and mountains.

I've done **Python**, **C++**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Assembly**. You can see some of my more recent stuff in C++ and Assembly in my repos.
